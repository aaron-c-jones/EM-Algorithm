# EM-Algorithm---Python
EM algorithm coded in Python. Outputs predicted missing data, number of iterations until convergence, and the optimized mean vector and covariance matrix.
To test the code, I randomly generate 500 observations from a trivariate normal distribution (see code for the mu and sigma used to generate this data). I then randomly insert NAs into the data to be predicted using the EM-algorithm.
