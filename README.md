# EM-Algorithm
EM algorithm coded in Python. Code output includes completed data, number of iterations to reach convergence, and the optimized mean vector and covariance matrix.

To test the code, 500 observations were randomly generate from trivariate normal distribution (see code for the mu and sigma used to generate this data). Then, I randomly inserted NAs into the data that will be estimated by the algorithm. Missing data file uploaded as CSV.
